 # Notes App

This is a simple Notes App that allows users to create groups for organizing their notes. Users can create, edit, and delete notes within these groups. The app also provides functionalities such as validation checks, error handling, and local storage persistence.

## Features

- **Group Creation**: Users can create groups for organizing their notes. A popup window allows users to specify a name and color for the group. Clicking outside the popup closes it.

- **Note Creation**: Users can add notes within a particular group. The app displays the creation date and time of each note.

- **Save Note**: Users can save a note by clicking on the Send icon in the text input area. The Send icon is disabled if no text is present.

- **Local Storage Persistence**: Notes and groups persist on page reload or refresh. Data is stored locally using the browser's local storage feature.

- **Group Change**: When users change the group, the app fetches all notes related to that particular group.

- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be both desktop and mobile responsive.

- **Validation Checks and Error Handling**: The app includes validation checks and error handling for group and note creation to ensure a smooth user experience.
